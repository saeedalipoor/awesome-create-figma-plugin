# Contributing

The list of plugins is only for:
- Plugins that are made using the Create Figma Plugin toolkit.
- Plugins that are open source.
- Plugins that have been approved by Figma and available on Figma Community.

Plugins should be added to `plugin.json`. Then, run the `build` script to regenerate the `README.md`.
